# Scripts

Folder contains scripts:

- `fixit.js`
  - will fix problems with italics
  - meant to be run after importing from Google Doc
  - e.g. `_hello _` where there is an erroneous space
  - this script may have errors; please manually check
- `markdown-footnote-order.js`
  - fixes footnotes `[1], [1a], [2]` to be `[1], [2], [3]`
  - purely for aesthetics; not needed
  - this script is now an [npm package](https://github.com/whyboris/Fix-Markdown-Footnotes)
- `translate-links.js`
  - helps if the translated documents have hardcoded links to _utilitarianism.net_
  - requires manual steps that are annoying, but still faster than not using a script
  - instructions inside
  - move into root directory to run
