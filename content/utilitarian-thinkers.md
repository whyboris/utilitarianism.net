Utilitarian ideas go back in part to the works of philosophers in ancient China, including Mozi, and ancient Greece, including Epicurus.[^1] Utilitarianism was further developed, refined and promoted in the late 18th and early 19th century by the classical utilitarians, Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick. 

These articles summarize the lives and ideas of the major utilitarian philosophers. For a much more detailed historical account than we can provide on this website, we recommend the book _[The Happiness Philosophers: The Lives and Works of the Great Utilitarians](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691154770/the-happiness-philosophers)_ and the article [The History of Utilitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/ ) on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Wikipedia also maintains a [list of utilitarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_utilitarians).
