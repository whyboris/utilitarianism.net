Utilitarian ideas go back in part to the works of philosophers in ancient China, including Mozi, and ancient Greece, including Epicurus.[^1] Utilitarianism was further developed, refined and promoted in the late 18th and early 19th century by the classical utilitarians, Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick. 

These articles summarize the lives and ideas of the major utilitarian philosophers. For a much more detailed historical account than we can provide on this website, we recommend the book _[The Happiness Philosophers: The Lives and Works of the Great Utilitarians](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691154770/the-happiness-philosophers)_ and the article [The History of Utilitarianism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/ ) on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Wikipedia also maintains a [list of utilitarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_utilitarians).

**Mozi (墨翟)** (c. 430 BCE) was a Chinese philosopher who founded the philosophical school of Mohism during China’s Warring States Period (475 - 221 BCE). Mozi and his followers advocated for universalist, impartial ethical views, making them ancient predecessors of utilitarianism.[^2]

**Harriet Taylor Mill** (1807 - 1858) was a British philosopher and women’s rights advocate. A close friend and later wife of John Stuart Mill, the two collaborated closely on many works.

**Henry Sidgwick** (1838 - 1900) was a British philosopher and economist. One of the classical utilitarians, he wrote one of the most important statements of utilitarianism in his _[The Methods of Ethics](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/sidgwick1874.pdf)_, which was said to be “the best book ever written on ethics”.[^4]

One of the most influential moral philosophers of the twentieth century, Hare is most famous for his meta-ethical theory of [prescriptivism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-cognitivism/#PreUniPre), which he used to argue for utilitarianism.
