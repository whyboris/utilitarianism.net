## Our Purpose

This website serves as a textbook introduction to utilitarianism at the undergraduate level. It provides a concise, accessible and engaging introduction to modern utilitarianism. There is a particular focus on classical utilitarianism, as we believe it remains the most compelling version of utilitarianism. The content of this website aims to be understandable to a broad audience, avoiding philosophical jargon where possible and providing definitions where necessary.

“I'll certainly be referring my students to this very useful resource. Enthusiasm for utilitarianism among moral philosophers has ebbed and flowed since the modern version of it was laid out in the nineteenth-century; but the importance of the utilitarian tradition in providing elaborate, well-developed, general theories for thinking about how we ought to behave has been clear all along. This site provides lucid introductions to the major contributions of and challenges to utilitarian thinking, today.”

“Utilitarianism.net is the online face of utilitarianism and a portal into a realm of world-changing ideas. Utilitarian thought has advanced human progress for centuries, and yet this philosophy is widely misunderstood. Utilitarianism.net is not only the most inviting and illuminating resource on utilitarianism for students. Its updated historical entries, rigorous dialectical explanations, and applications to real-world problems make it a fantastic resource for seasoned scholars as well.”

“Gaining knowledge has never been as easy as in the era of widespread internet access. Utilitarianism.net is the result of the work and commitment of many great philosophers from around the world. It is a project that helps you to understand one of the most important and interesting ethical theories in an accessible yet not oversimplified way.”

“Utilitarianism.net is the place to go for clear, full and fair accounts of what utilitarianism is, the arguments for it, the main objections to it, special issues like population ethics, and what living as a utilitarian involves. You will also discover thinkers you never knew about, like the early utilitarian Susanna Newcome. I recommend it to all my students interested in normative ethics.”

This website was launched from [Queen's Lane Coffee House](http://www.qlcoffeehouse.com/) in Oxford, where [Jeremy Bentham](/utilitarian-thinker/jeremy-bentham) first discovered utilitarianism:

![Queen's Lane Coffee House](/img/about/Queens-Lane-Coffee-House.jpg "Queen's Lane Coffee House")

<div class="coffee-house">

> "Dr. Priestley published his Essay on Government in 1768. He there introduced as the only reasonable and proper object of government, ‘**the greatest happiness of the greatest number.**’ (...) Somehow or other, shortly after its publication, a copy of this pamphlet found its way into the little circulating library belonging to a **little coffee-house attached to Queen’s College, Oxford.** It was a corner house, having one front towards the High Street, another towards a narrow lane, which on that side skirts Queen’s College, and loses itself in a lane issuing from one of the gates of New College. (...)
>
> It was by that pamphlet, and this phrase in it, that my principles on the subject of morality, public and private together, were determined. It was from that pamphlet and that page of it, that I drew the phrase, the words and import of which have been so widely diffused over the civilized world. At the sight of it, I cried out, as it were, in an inward ecstasy, like Archimedes on the discovery of the fundamental principle of hydrostatics, eureka!"

\- Bentham, J. (1834). Deontology, or the Science of Morality. _The British Critic, Quarterly Theological Review, and Ecclesiastical Record_. 16(32): 279–280.
