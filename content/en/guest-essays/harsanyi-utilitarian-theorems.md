summary: "This essay explains, as simply and intuitively as possible, Harsanyi’s three famous arguments for utilitarian aggregation: the social-aggregation theorem, the impartial-observer theorem, and the separability theorem. While Harsanyi’s contribution does not completely establish utilitarianism, it transforms how we think about aggregation in ethics. The key question becomes not whether to add up, but what to add up."

According to classical utilitarianism, well-being consists in pleasure or happiness, the good consists in the sum of well-being, and moral rightness consists in maximizing the good. Leibniz was perhaps the first to formulate this doctrine. Bentham made it widely known. For a long time, however, the second, summing part lacked any clear foundation. John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, and Richard Hare all gave arguments for utilitarianism, but they took this summing part for granted. It was John Harsanyi who finally presented compelling arguments for this controversial part of the utilitarian doctrine.

Much of his work covers theoretical problems in ethics, value theory, and political philosophy. And much of the rest is on decision theory and, more specifically, on money pumps and moral uncertainty.
