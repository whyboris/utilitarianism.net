summary: "This essay explains, as simply and intuitively as possible, Harsanyi’s three famous arguments for utilitarian aggregation: the social-aggregation theorem, the impartial-observer theorem, and the separability theorem. While Harsanyi’s contribution does not completely establish utilitarianism, it transforms how we think about aggregation in ethics. The key question becomes not whether to add up, but what to add up."

[Johan-Gustafsson](https://johanegustafsson.net/) is a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, a senior research fellow in philosophy at University of York, and a docent in practical philosophy at Institute for Futures Studies. He work primarily on the parts of philosophy that relate to the question of what we ought to do, either morally or rationally. Much of his work covers theoretical problems in ethics, value theory, and political philosophy. And much of the rest is on decision theory and, more specifically, on money pumps and moral uncertainty.
