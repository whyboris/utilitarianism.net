<h2>What is Utilitarianism?</h2>

Utilitarians want all lives to go as well as possible, counting everyone's well-being equally. On this view, what matters most is bringing about the best overall consequences by improving the lives of sentient beings—regardless of their gender, race, nationality, or even [species](/guest-essays/utilitarianism-and-nonhuman-animals#the-moral-status-of-animals).

## Acting on Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism has important implications for how we should think about leading an ethical life. Because utilitarianism weighs everyone's well-being equally, it implies that we should make helping others a very significant part of our lives.

There are many pressing problems in the world today. Unfortunately, because our resources are scarce, we cannot solve all the world’s problems at once. What is more, not all ways of helping others are equally effective. According to utilitarianism we should carefully choose which problems to work on and by what means, based on how we can most improve lives, each counting equally. This involves taking seriously the question of how we can best use our time and money to help others.

A few moral projects appear especially pressing by utilitarian lights, such as [fighting extreme poverty](/acting-on-utilitarianism#global-health-and-development), [reducing the suffering of animals on factory farms](/acting-on-utilitarianism#farm-animal-welfare), and, in particular, [protecting and improving the long-term future](/acting-on-utilitarianism#existential-risk-reduction). Future people greatly outnumber those who are alive today, and we may be able to improve their well-being. Therefore, one key concern for utilitarians is to promote the well-being of not only the current generation but of all generations to come.

Addressing these problems may involve [donating generously to effective charities](/acting-on-utilitarianism#charitable-giving), [choosing your career based on how to most help others](/acting-on-utilitarianism#career-choice), and [encouraging other people to do the same](/acting-on-utilitarianism#outreach).
